## Learning process (Q & A).

### What is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language, 
created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.                                                                                                        
The design focuses on readability using indentation
and it can be used for:

* Web development (backend)
* AI and machine learning 
* Data analytics
* Data visualisation
* Programming applications 
* Language development
* Game development
* SEO
* Finance 
 


### What is OOP?
OOP stands for object-oriented programming and it's a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects.      
The four principles of OOP are:

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

### What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism means “many shapes” in Greek.  It's an OOP concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms.             The concept is borrowed from a principle in biology where an organism or species can have many different forms or stages.       
Polymorphism helps to write powerful, complex abstractions from simpler ones.
 
### What is an IDE?
An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.  
It's like text editors to write letters and spreadsheets for accounting.
 
### What is pair programming?
Pair programming is an Agile practice in which two programmers work together at one computer, sharing one screen, keyboard and mouse.                                The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the “driver”, the other is the “navigator” collaborating on the same work. The programmers may swap roles every few minutes or so.

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
Timeboxing is an Agile practice used for personal time management by assigning a maximum amount of time to an activity.   

No, I haven't heard of it before but it seams like many successful software developers use to increase productivity, so yes I have plans to use it.

### What is a variable?
Variables are containers (a part of the computer's memory) to store, retrieve, and use data.
 
### What is a fixed mindset?
A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work, they love a challange.

### What is conscious listening?
It's realizing that you need to put focus on what you are listening to. Listening is work, it takes effort.
Opposite of passive listening, passive listening is when someone hears but does not fully process or respond to shared information.

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be used by a customers and then provide feedback for future product development.
For kids I would explain that MVP is like learning to use a bicycle before creating a motorcycle.

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
Yes, I took a break every 2 hours or so from the screen. 
Yes, I try to stretch at least once a day.

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?
Yes, by googling and trying to code.

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
Yes, Woodworking. It took a lot of practice, research and love for the craft.

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
No, not yet.
                                           
### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
I do value creativity for sure! Yes, creativity involves critical thinking, planning and focusing my attention.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
10 tabs, 100/100 for study.

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
Yes I'm. I find it very helpful for sure.

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
To code with confidence.

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
Programming is like giving instructions to a computer to do a task.

### Have you developed a habit of persevering?
Yes, in many areas of my life.
